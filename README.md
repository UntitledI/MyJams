# Overview:  
As the lead backend developer for MyJams, I led the design and implementation of the backend infrastructure for a personalized music recommendation web application. MyJams aimed to provide users with tailored music recommendations based on their preferences, leveraging data from the Spotify API and user interaction.  

## Technologies Used:  

Frontend Framework: Nuxt.js (Vue.js)  
Backend Framework: Express.js  
Database: MongoDB  
External API: Spotify API  
Authentication: Spotify OAuth  
## Responsibilities:  

* Integration with the Spotify API: I implemented functionality to interface with the Spotify API to access music metadata, user playlists, and playback information. This involved utilizing the Spotify API endpoints to retrieve track data, user playlists, and user authentication using OAuth.  

* Utilization of Spotify OAuth: I integrated Spotify OAuth authentication to allow users to securely log in to MyJams using their Spotify accounts. By leveraging Spotify OAuth, users could grant MyJams limited access to their Spotify data, such as playlists and listening history, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience.  

* Creation of User Preference Profiles: Using MongoDB as our database solution, I designed the database schema to store user preference profiles. These profiles were populated based on user interactions with the MyJams platform, including liked songs, skipped songs, and listening history. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, we created personalized music recommendation profiles for each user.
